CAMERA_CONNECTION USERNAME CANNOT CONTAIN: -
cameraconnection username and password must be unique

update ssl keys, to keys that work :)


api.js:
- getting this error while i shuld not SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed

optimization:
- using cache for: api.js, host.js (do we need)

constant.js:
- dont store jwtSecret in plaintext.

host.js: 
- make it so user cache updates when a new user is made, so it dosent need to make a request eatch second
- time complexity for loggin in is O(n) where n is the amount of users. this is because of the caching (better sulution?)
- add timeout?

login.js: 
- add displaying of messages from uri: /login?message=You%20need%20to%20login%20to%20acces%20this%20page!
- cant contain anything from this list: ["~", "`", "!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "-", "_", "+", "=", "{", "}", "[", "]", "|", "/", "\", ":", ";", "\"", "`", "<", ">", ",", ".", "?"]
- username over 5 charachters.
- password over 5 charachters.
- cannot contain special charachters
